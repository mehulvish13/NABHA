## 🔐 Security Considerations

## 🎨 Customization
To customize colors, update CSS variables in `style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #2563eb;    /* Main brand color */
    --secondary: #10b981;  /* Secondary color */
    --accent: #f59e0b;     /* Accent color */
}
```

## 📊 Analytics (Optional)
To add analytics, insert before closing `</head>` tag in `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics or your preferred analytics -->
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Styles not loading
- Check that `style.css` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- Verify file permissions

### JavaScript not working
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `script.js` is in the same directory
- Verify the file has `defer` attribute in HTML

### Mobile menu not working
- Clear browser cache
- Check that Font Awesome is loading correctly
